20. Math Operators: plus, minus, multiply, divide, to the power ( +,  -, * ,  /,  ** )
	- Division always results in float 
	- Precedence: paranthesis, exponents, (multiply, divide Left To Right), (+,- Left To Right) 
22.  F Strings
	- Var += 1 # same as var=var + 1
	- f strings save a lot of conversions
	- `f "your score is {score}"` works even if score is integer or float
	- `print (f "your score is & score}, your height is {height}, you are winning is{isWinning}")`
	- in an f string `:.x` behind a float displays x characters after the decimal point. `print (f"Each person should pay {answer:.2f3")`
27.  If Else greater than >, less than <, greater than or equal >=, less than or equal <=, equal == 
	- if CONDITION: 
		- Do Something
	- else: 
		- Do Something else
