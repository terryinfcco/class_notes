# Streamlit Capabilities

- Video 1
    - streamlit run main.py  - To run a streamlit program in the terminal
    - default port is 8501
    - st.title - Like an H1
    - st.header - Like an H2
    - st.subheader - Like an H3
    - st.text - Plain text
- Video 2
    - st.markdown() - just put markdown in the parentheses
    - #'s for headers - more #'s means smaller header
    - `**bold text**`
    - `*italic text*`
    - `> Put something in block quotes
    - `st.markdown("1. First Item\n 2. Second Item") # An ordered list
    - `st.code(str)` Where str = "print('Hello World')"  Not markdown - part of Streamlit
    - st.markdown(---) # Horizontal rule
    - `st.markdown('[Google](https://www.google.com/)')` # Link in Markdown
    - tables are possible - but painful looking IMHO
    - json feature st.json(json)
    - emojis possible

    - Metric function - able to show numbers with delta to indicate changes over time
    - tables using pandas library
    - dataframe is a table that allows sorting by clicking column headers

    - Images - can have captions, change height (he didn't show so ?) and width

    - Button widget - has a value of True or False
    - text_input - type into a one line field. Can have line of code above the box
    - st.write() - writes text onto web page - not sure how this is different from st.text

    - Created a list of two images - when he pointed an image element at the list rather than a single image, the images ended up side by side rather than on top of each other.
    - He also created a list of captions and used that in the image element rather than one caption. And it worked.
    - Link Button - link_button, text for button and http address are parameters
- Video 8
    - Checkbox widget. Each checkbox is a separate widget. Has a value of True or False
    - Column variable allows to put checkboxes side by side rather than above and below. I suspect this is more versatile than just checkboxes
- Video 9
    - Toggle widget - slider appearance. Boolean value of True or False
    - Again uses columns to put toggles side by side
- Video 10
    - Radio buttons - Only one button active at a time.
    - A title and then a list of button titles in the parameters.
    - Uses button titles to determine which button is active (True)
    - Can use index parameter to select which button is active initially, set to None to not select a button initially
    - Can use disabled parameter to deactivate all the buttons.

    - Slider object - slide to value in a range
    - First parameter is title of object, 2nd and 3rd are range of slider, 4th is default value
