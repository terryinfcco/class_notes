title: Arch - Aargh!

I restored a version of Arch using clonezilla and tried to set up Jekyll. It
didn't work and I don't know why I insist on trying to use Arch. I would like
to use the i3 window manager, but I think tomorrow I'm going to install Xubuntu
and install and run i3 from there.

Then again there's always the possibility that no amount of screwing around with
window managers or desktop environments will make much difference. So maybe I
should just focus on studying whatever it is that I'm going to study.
