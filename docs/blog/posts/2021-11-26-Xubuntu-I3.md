title: Xubuntu and I3WM

OK, I installed Xubuntu 21.10 and it was OK once I stopped trying to resize the old Arch partition and
just deleted and recreated it. Then I grabbed an old pi4 i3wm config file and i3blocks file. Installed i3, i3blocks, and rofi. After a bunch of editing of the config file, installing lxappearance, codium, atom, nextcloud, dropbox, and syncthing, I've got a working system.

Then I followed the jekyll instructions for installing jekyll on Ubuntu and now I've got the whole thing working. Now I'm working on transferring the files to my local server (192.168.86.20) using rsync. Right now I need to check if using the rsync chown option will work.

I messed up Nextcloud when moving the DocumentRoot of Apache2 on 192.168.86.20. I'm not even sure I care - I wasn't using any of the nextcloud apps and syncthing seems to do what I want.

Got simple-scan working on my xubuntu / i3 desktop. Yay.
