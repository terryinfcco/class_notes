So I'm thinking that the 2 forward facing internet sites should probably be just things
like Jekyll and MkDocs where I've got the original stored on Nextcloud or Syncthing
so that if I get hacked I can just nuke and pave the site. That means that tools like
Django, Flask, Tiddlywiki, and Dokuwiki are better left on my Raspberry Pi's that I'm
using as home servers.

I played around a bunch trying to work out a blog on MkDocs and really didn't like anything
I saw. I think I need to get back to work on the Jekyll site - just have posts there and
for documentation get a really nice MkDocs site going.
