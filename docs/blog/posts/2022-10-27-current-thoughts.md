# Current Thoughts

I'm currently thinking of having 3 online note taking places: 

  * The first is this Jekyll site for keeping a log of activities and thoughts. 
  * Second is a Todo Tiddlywiki site with three index pages - Active, Perhaps, and Completed Tasks.
  * Third is MkDocs - it's still the best product for documentation. Although I have to admit to being pretty happy with the paper notes I took from the Tech With Tim curses playlist on Youtube. Maybe I don't need a documentation site at all.

And I think it would be nice to have these all on a fairly low powered Raspberry Pi. Maybe the Pi 4 I've got or maybe even trying it on an old Pi 2. I think I'll look up the power consumption difference. Although thinking about it, not having USB3 on the Pi 2 is a strike against the Pi 2.
