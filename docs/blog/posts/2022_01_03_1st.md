January 3, 2022 - Grav, Wordpress

So I felt like I didn't like Grav because a normal user couldn't edit posts - but I'm not nuts about Wordpress either, so I'm going to take a shot at Grav for a few days and see what I think.

Couldn't even get Grav to add a post. No idea why. Gave up. Back to Jekyll for blogging. Aargh!!!

I've said this before but I think I just need to pick something and power through it.
