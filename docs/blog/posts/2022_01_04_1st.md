January 4, 2022 - Web Development

I want to put a picture on a page of a web site and I have no idea how to do it easily.
I either have to get back to CSS or Bootstrap. My first inclination is Bootstrap. And
I suppose there are other front end frameworks that would also work. Maybe I'll investigate.

They're not quite up to date, but I could use John Elder's HTML, Bootstrap, and Javascript
courses to do this. OK never mind, I started the Incredible HTML/CSS course on Udemy over
again. Part of it is just so I can actually finish a course, but another part is to
learn enough HTML and CSS to make sense of either Django or Flask. I might throw in
some Bootstrap too, but so far this is where my head is.
