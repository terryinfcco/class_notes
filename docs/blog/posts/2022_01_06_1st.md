January 6, 2022 - Jekyll on Arch

Installed Jekyll on Arch and got it working. Some updates needed to my instructions that I have stored in Dokuwiki, so I updated those. Good for me.

Installed mate-polkit and autotiling and copied the respective lines from the Arch i3 config file that came from the cyberpower pc.

Worked on the openbox install on Arch on the Beelink and think it's pretty good so I have the choice of doing either i3 or openbox. Now to make sure the rsync dotfiles script works.
