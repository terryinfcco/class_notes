I want to be more organized. I want to use this Learning Log to plan what I want to accomplish on a regular basis. It's not difficult to keep up, 
even though I won't be able to do updates on my tablet or phone. But it would be pretty easy if I really want to capture something to put it in Google Keep and just copy over and format the next day.

If I really want to accomplish things, I think the best way is to write python tkinter apps. Again I won't be able to update them on my tablet or phone, but again I can put stuff in Google Keep and update the next time I'm at a computer.
