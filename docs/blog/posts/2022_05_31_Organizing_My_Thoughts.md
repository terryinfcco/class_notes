title: Organizing My Thoughts - Journal May 31, 2022

I'm thinking that I want 3 different sites on probably github. 

* One is just a blog for keeping track of my 
thoughts on a dated basis. Right now it's this repo: "https://github.com/terryinfcco/GT_blog". This might also be suitable for my learning log. Just have to  make sure to do categories correctly so I can go back and find stuff.
* One is for documentation and taking notes as I work through courses. Right now it's an mkdocs instance that I'm using: "https://github.com/terryinfcco/mkdocs". Probably need to rename.
* The third is for planning - maybe an mkdocs instance. It would have 2 sections. One would be perhaps kinds of stuff. Probably an index page with the titles each referring to a detail page. The other would be a todo list. Again with an index page that has entries to detail pages. This doesn't exist yet. Created - in "https://github.com/terryinfcco/new_mkdocs". Probably need to rename.
