title: Django Journal at Better Programming - Journal June 4, 2022

I finished organizing my notes from the article about Creating a Journal App in Django. It was written by Esther Vaati and was posted at https://betterprogramming.pub/build-a-personal-journal-with-django-and-python-f4835d27368c. I really liked the article. I thought it was well written and appropriate for a person who had learned some Django theory and wanted to see it applied. 

The notes are stored as Markdown files in Dropbox/LinuxDropbox/Django_Journal_Better_Programming. I also had them in a github repository as an mkdocs instance, but since most of the notes I'm taking are of copyright material, I think it's probably not good to post them in public. The local version of the github repo still exists but I think I should be careful where I post it. I can still run mkdocs locally to see the notes nicely formatted.

I'm going to attempt to follow the instructions and install it on my raspberry pi 4 server downstairs. Then I think I can adapt the Journal to also be a ToDo list. And maybe a learning log.
