title: Tkinter, Django, ToDo List, and Study Plans

I'm pretty happy with what I accomplished yesterday when I took the Digital Diary
app from github and converted it for my own use and then also modified it to be a
todo / task list.

But I really like the ability to do this stuff from the web even if it's only a local
server on a raspberry pi. So I'm going back to studying Django. I'm going to use
John Elder's courses first on codemy.com and later the youtube ones, especially
the one about building a blog that ends up in django 4 by the end.

As far as studying goes, I still like the use of my GT_notes jekyll site that's both
local and on github for creating notes about stuff that doesn't end up in a program
and for just commenting the bejesus out of the code as I write it. So a flow in GT_notes
that doesn't include code. Or if it does, code that's just copied from the source and
pasted in the markdown documents.
