title: Jekyll and Bluetooth Arch Linux

Got bluetooth working on Arch on the Beelink I5. Just missed installing one thing from the instructions in the Arch Wiki. Had some
trouble with wifi when I first started Arch, so I went through the iwctl process and it seems to be working fine now.

Installed Jekyll on Arch and have it working. Followed the instructions for the gem install on the Arch Wiki.

Didn't do any studying but not unhappy with what I accomplished. I'm working toward a more mouseless approach with Arch and 
i3wm. I think I can be happier with that. 

Pretty sure I don't want to keep uploading this technology "diary" to Github. The notes Jekyll site, maybe. 

And I think sitting here every evening after dinner and whatever TV we watch, and updating this technology diary would be a great
habit to continue.
