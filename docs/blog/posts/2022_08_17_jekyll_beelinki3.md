title: Jekyll Kubuntu Terrystudent Arch - Journal August 17, 2022

Went to use my Arch Linux stuff from yesterday and it failed to connect to my headphones. I quit....

Back to the terrystudent installation on Kubuntu on the Beelink i5. I worked on the jekyll_upload.sh script and
got it working to backup this installation to Dropbox/jekyll/GT_blog and to build the site and upload it to the beelink i3 webserver.



Thinking as always that I need to pick something and stick to it. I keep trying to find something that I want to build and I've looked at Django todo lists, Django diaries, etc. Nothing seems better that what I've already got: Jekyll for a tech diary, and probably tiddlywiki for a todo list. So one thought is to pick something and really stick to it, not worrying about what I might do with it. Or figure out something that I really want to do (freecell most efficient solver?) and just do it. One thought is to go back to the youaccel web development course and stick through it. By then I'd have gone through HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP. Maybe that would give me some ideas of something to do.
