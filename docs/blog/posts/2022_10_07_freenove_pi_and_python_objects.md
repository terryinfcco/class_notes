# Freenove Pi and Python Objects

I think I have the pi 400 and the pi 3 hooked up to be able to work through the freenove ultimate starter kit. I need to redo my understanding of addressing GPIO pins, although part of my problem today was a bad male to male jumper.

I watched more of the FreeCodeCamp Python OOP video and more of the objects course that I got free on Udemy. I sometimes wonder why I just don't fight my way through the Angela Yu 100 days course. But I do think I'm getting a handle on using objects and how I might use them in the digital diary program that I'm going to create but never use.
