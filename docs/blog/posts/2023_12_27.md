## 2023_12_27 

I was unhappy when I couldn't use Udemy from Raspberry Pi OS. I started the bro code HTML CSS course but it's not the same. I'm considering giving up on the raspberry pi 5 for the time being. Or I could try to connect 3 computers. The video is easy with the hdmi switches but the daisy chain for the keyboard and mouse I'm less sure of.
