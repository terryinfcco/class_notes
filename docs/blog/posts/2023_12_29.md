Back to using the trigkey computer. I installed debian with the kde desktop. I got back to the codemy Django simple blog course, restarted it and did the first video. I cleaned up my notes which are in the mkdocs Github class_notes repository. I need to create a script to be able to upload the build to dutchdocs. xyz.

I have both the trigkey and the pi 5 connected as well as the cyber power. Works fine. Still can't use Udemy on the pi.
