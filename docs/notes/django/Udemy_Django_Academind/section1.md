# Django Practical Guide Section 1

## Getting Started

## Notes

### What is Django

HTML, CSS and Javascript still used for the front end. Django is just a python back end / web development framework. Tools for sessions, databases, request / response. And a clear set of rules for projects. Django is "opinionated". Still customizable and flexible. 

### Course Prequisites

Basic Python knowledge. Basic Web Development knowledge. Request / response, HTML, CSS, Javascript. 

### What's Inside the Course

Three main pillars: Foundation - URL's, Routes, Views, Templates, Static Files, Data, Models

Beyond the Basics - Forms, Class based views, File Uploads, Sessions

Preparing for Reality - Many Small Examples, A Real Project Blog, Front End + Admin Area, Implementation. 

### Getting the most out of the course. 

Watch the videos. Don't hesitate to repeat as necessary. Use playback speed if too slow or fast. Code along and code ahead. Compare your approach to his. Use code attachments - github repo's for each section. 

### Course Path

Standard approach - start with video 1 and go in order. At end is a Django summary module. Great recap and refresh.

Summary Approach - just take the summary. Not recommended.
