## Set up a Development Environment
* install Python3
* install Pip3
* install venv
* You need a text editor
* Make sure you have a terminal app / a command line.

## Create a Virtual Environment
``` bash
mkdir code
cd code
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip freeze 
```
## Install Django - make sure venv is active
```pip install django```


## Create a new Django Project
``` bash
# Make sure you're in code and the venv is active
mkdir djangoproject
cd djangoproject
django-admin startproject mysite .
# This creates a mysite subdirectory and a manage.py file
```

## Run the Django Devlopment Server
``` bash
# Make sure you're in code/djangoproject
python manage.py runserver
# go to localhost:8000 in a browser to make sure you get successful install screen
```

## Fix the migration errors
```
# To fix the initial migrations errors you get
python3 manage.py migrate
# This also creates the admin section which can be accessed at localhost:8000/admin
```

## Create the Superuser
```
python manage.py createsuperuser
# give a username, email, and password
# Now can login at localhost:8000/admin/
```

## Notes

I think I did the last two steps on the pi 400 in the basement, but they didn't exist when I moved upstairs. So they either don't get put on gitlab or I forgot to do a git push at the end.
